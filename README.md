1 Description

BiArkit is a versatile toolkit that integrates different modules together and helps researchers approach information on synthetic biology. The first kit is GenomeBrowser, which visualizes the genomes of some model microorganisms, locates the genes on the genome and makes it easy to study the genomes. Secondly, Biobrick from the registry are transformed into the localized search tool. Thirdly, Riboswitch and SiRNA assist the design of regulatory elements. Fourthly, we have developed MetaNetwork to optimize the methods of scanning and output of the existing database of pathways. Fifthly, to analyze the dynamic change in various metabolic networks, we present the Simulator that help researchers analyze the network in silico. Sixthly, G-Circle is designed to illustrate the expression level of different genomes under the given environment.  Further, to make it more convenient, the software is localized; that is to say, all functions mentioned above can be achieved without linkage to Internet. <FONT COLOR="RED"><B>All the functional modules have been successfully added to the Clotho Frame</FONT></B>.
