BiArkit is a versatile toolkit that integrates different modules together and helps researchers approach information on synthetic biology. The first function is GenomeBrowser, which visualizes the genomes of some model microorganisms, locates the genes on the genome and makes it easy to study the genomes. Secondly, Riboswitch and SiRNA assist the design of regulatory elements. Thirdly, we optimize the methods of scanning and output of the existing database of pathways. Fourthly, to analyze the dynamic change in various metabolic networks, we present a simulator that help the researchers analyze the network in silico. Fifthly, we have developed a tool to illustrate the genomes and their expression level under given conditions. It has been added to the Clotho. Further, to make it more convenient, the software is localized; that is to say, all functions mentioned above can be achieved without linkage to Internet.
